# In general, we should care more about consistency and avoidance of
# bike-shedding than any specific aesthetic choice on code quality.
#
# However, in some cases, the default Rubocop rules merit changing where their
# defaults don't optimally live up to some additional values:
#
# 1. Correctness
#
#    If a certain style will generally result in fewer errors, it should be
#    preferred. E.g.: using attr_readers instead of @ivars will produce
#    noticeable exceptions vs un-noticed nils; prefixed access modifiers to
#    method definitions prevent accidental scope changes as methods are moved.
#
# 2. Focused diffs
#
#    Trailing commas, aligning relative to indentation level (params,
#    conditional assignment, etc), minimising whitespace changes, "flat" module
#    namespacing, all produce less whitespace noise in diffs as they change and
#    evolve.
#
# 3. Code clarity
#
#    Access modifier prefixes and allowing for some flexibility in formatting
#    numbers improve the ability to communicate intent and context in code.
#    Likewise, choosing whether to use guard clauses or conditionals is a
#    matter of readability that a developer can judge better than a linter.
#
# 4. Pragmatism
#
#    Formatting code for easy paste-ability into IRB/Pry is a good example of
#    this.
#
# 5. Appropriate subjectivity
#
#    Certain choices are best made by a human code reviewer, not a linter.
#    While consistency is important, it can sometimes be in conflict with
#    clarity or other team values.
