# Snowfall `modules/`

See https://snowfall.org/guides/lib/modules/

Files in this directory are [Nix Modules](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/NixOS_modules).

Snowfall automatically looks for and loads modules in the following location: `./{darwin,nixos,home}/*/default.nix`, depending on the current target, and provides the following attribute set as arguments:

```nix
{
    # Snowfall Lib provides a customized `lib` instance with access to your flake's library
    # as well as the libraries available from your flake's inputs.
    lib,
    # An instance of `pkgs` with your overlays and packages applied is also available.
    pkgs,
    # You also have access to your flake's inputs.
    inputs,

    # Additional metadata is provided by Snowfall Lib.
    namespace, # The namespace used for your flake, defaulting to "internal" if not set.
    system, # The system architecture for this host (eg. `x86_64-linux`).
    target, # The Snowfall Lib target for this system (eg. `x86_64-iso`).
    format, # A normalized name for the system target (eg. `iso`).
    virtual, # A boolean to determine whether this system is a virtual target using nixos-generators.
    systems, # An attribute map of your defined hosts.

    # All other arguments come from the module system.
    config,
    ...
}:
{
    # Your configuration.
}
```
