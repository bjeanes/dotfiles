# Snowfall `systems/`

See https://snowfall.org/guides/lib/systems/.

Create a Nix file for each system/host at `systems/<target>/<hostname>/default.nix` where `<target>` is a string
corresponding to a Nix system identifier (e.g. `aarch64-darwin`, `x86_64-linux`).

Each system definition looks something like:

```nix
{
  # Snowfall Lib provides a customized `lib` instance with access to your flake's library
  # as well as the libraries available from your flake's inputs.
  lib,
  # An instance of `pkgs` with your overlays and packages applied is also available.
  pkgs,
  # You also have access to your flake's inputs.
  inputs,

  # Additional metadata is provided by Snowfall Lib.
  namespace, # The namespace used for your flake, defaulting to "internal" if not set.
  system, # The system architecture for this host (eg. `x86_64-linux`).
  target, # The Snowfall Lib target for this system (eg. `x86_64-iso`).
  format, # A normalized name for the system target (eg. `iso`).
  virtual, # A boolean to determine whether this system is a virtual target using nixos-generators.
  systems, # An attribute map of your defined hosts.

  # All other arguments come from the system system.
  config,
  ...
}:
{
  my.config.here = 123;

  snowfallorg.users.my-user = {
    create = true; # Defaults to true
    admin = true; # Defaults to true

    home = {
      enable = true; # Defaults to true
      path = "/mnt/home/my-user"; # Defaults to sane place for both macOS and Linux

      config = { }; # Passed to Home Manager
    };
  };
}
```
